* What's in a search engine?
** Building the collection
- 'crawling': starting with small set of documents, and following
  links
- Or might already have a collection
** Indexing
- big table of documents, locations of different words within them
- some way of getting to the document from its entry in the table (a
  link, or perhaps storing document itself in the table)
** Extracting ranked list from query
- Simple to extract documents with a given set of words, given an
  index
- Challenge is to extract most *relevent* documents.  How the results
  are sorted.
* urllib2
- standard python library
- "makes it easy to download pages - just provide URL"
* SQLite:
- "an embedded database that is very easy to set up, and stores a
  whole database in one file."
- SQL for queries, so code can be easily ported to use a different
  database.
